## The competition of frameworks

With so many technologies/frameworks been introduced to JavaScript ecosystem. People became excited and then exhausted. We are always trying to find which framework would eventually win, would that be React, Vue, Angular? TypeScript or JavaScript? CoffeeScript is gone? It's hard to tell which one is better in the flashpoint of JavaScript technologies. The suggestion from speakers would be, pick the one that you are most familiar with and go with it.
